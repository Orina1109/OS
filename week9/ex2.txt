1. The greater pagetable is, the greater hitrate is as well. It is obviouse by prob/stat theory. The more space we have, the less chance, that this room doesn't contain the thing we need.
2. To reach 100% hitrate, we just need to refernce to same memory cell every time: 100, 100, 100, and so on. Indead, hirate will not be 100%, beacouse we need to load page 100 to mamory, but it is the only time, when we need it
   To reach 0% hitrate, we need to load different pages with period that 1 greater then size of pagetable. For example, pagetable size = 3, page references: 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, and so on. When cell 1 will need to be accessed again, it's clear, that its previouse place was taken by 4. So, we need to allocate it again. And again for future references
